# force-english-ms-docs

## Introduction

This repository contains a simple browser extension for Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome (and potentially other Chromium-based web browsers) to force English Microsoft Docs. Microsoft Docs are often automatically and poorly translated into other languages when Microsoft decides that that is better for you. In most cases, this decision is frustrating, and in order to fix it, manual action is necessary to show English documentation. `Force English Microsoft Docs` saves you this hassle and will force English documentation automatically, every time you browse to Microsoft Docs. 

## Installation

There are 2 methods of installing the extension: 1) through one of the official online "stores", or 2) locally, by enabling developer mode. The first is the easiest and therefore the preferred method.

### Method 1: Online

`Force English Microsoft Docs` is available on [Edge Add-ons](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/force-english-microsoft-d/bdokbobllmhnkpghfckbkmbaheohckdo) and [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/force-english-microsoft-d/bedgpihphimbbgojjlhboegmfbhbhnjh).

### Method 2: Locally

First clone or download this repository. Then follow [this](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/2714278?hl=en) guide. (written from Chrome, but for Edge, the process is similar.)
